# COD Zombies Challenger
Is zombies a little too boring for you? You may use this to spice things up a little with some random challenges!

## Features
* **Random Loadout:** Instead of always picking the best starting loadout why not have some luck play into it and have it pick your gun, ammo mod(*optional*), and Field Upgrade, and if you want and even more luck play you can choose the ***preset*** option and that will instead of only using one gun you may use a gun class, example LMGs, with a pre-defined ammo mod and field upgrade.
* **Challenges:** Kind of the whole point of this program now huh? You can either pick a challenge from the list or have a random challenge applied to you. At the moment there are 12 challenges but will be added along the way and if you have one that would be fun don't be afraid to let me know so I could add it!

## Goals
* Have at least 50 challenges.
* Change presets to be more random: banning weapons/attachments & add a small built-in challenge per class.
